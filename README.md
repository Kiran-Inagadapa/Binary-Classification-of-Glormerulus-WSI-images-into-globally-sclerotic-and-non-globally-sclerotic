# Binary-Classification-of-Glormerulus-WSI-images-into-globally-sclerotic-and-non-globally-sclerotic

To solve the problem, two approaches were followed:

## 1. Stack Ensemble Method with two Base Learners and a Meta Learner:
#### link to folder: [STACK ENSEMBLE](https://github.com/Kiran-Inagadapa/Binary-Classification-of-Glormerulus-WSI-images-into-globally-sclerotic-and-non-globally-sclerotic/tree/main/STACK%20ENSEMBLE)
A README.md file is included in the Folder, that explains the implementation of this solution.
### Evaluation procedure:
-> evaluation.py is renamed as ['evaluation_stackedensemble.py'](https://github.com/Kiran-Inagadapa/Binary-Classification-of-Glormerulus-WSI-images-into-globally-sclerotic-and-non-globally-sclerotic/blob/main/STACK%20ENSEMBLE/evaluation_stackedensemble.py)

## 2. ResNet50V2:
#### link to folder: [RESNET50V2](https://github.com/Kiran-Inagadapa/Binary-Classification-of-Glormerulus-WSI-images-into-globally-sclerotic-and-non-globally-sclerotic/tree/main/RESNET50V2)
A README.md file is included in the Folder, that explains the implementation of this solution.
### Evaluation procedure:
-> evaluation.py is renamed as ['evaluation_resnet50v2'](https://github.com/Kiran-Inagadapa/Binary-Classification-of-Glormerulus-WSI-images-into-globally-sclerotic-and-non-globally-sclerotic/blob/main/RESNET50V2/evaluation_resnet50v2.py)
